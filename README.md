# Security Preparation Repository

Welcome to the Reboare/Booj Security wiki!

This was a fork of the [https://github.com/xapax/security](https://github.com/xapax/security) and [https://github.com/aranisec/security](https://github.com/aranisec/security) repositories, so the majority of the work in here is due to them, but I'll be adding and editing as I go through, so the majority of it from here on out will be my own work.

If you feel like this is a good start, but you want to add and remove things and just fork it and make it yours.  Hopefully we can all learn from each other in that way. 

## Disclaimer

Sometimes the line isn't very clear between the chapters. Some actions might be considered part of the vulnerability analysis-phase, but it could also but considered part of the recon-phase. It is what it is.

These chapters are written sporadically with a lot of stuff missing. I just add stuff wherever whenever. Also, things might not be accurate, I might have misunderstood something or misused a tool. So don't trust me or this book for any accuracy.
