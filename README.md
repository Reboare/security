# Security Prepration Repository

Welcome to the reboare/security wiki!

This has been forked from [https://github.com/xapax/security](https://github.com/xapax/security) and [https://github.com/aranisec/security](https://github.com/aranisec/security)

Also, this book is just a collection of stuff that is available on the interwebz. I am just a simple collector. I have tried to include a reference section to show where I found the technique. This book is my way of trying to give something back to the infosec community and I hope it can be useful to someone.

 If you feel like this is a good start, but you want to add and remove things and just make it yours you can just fork it and do whatever you want with it.

## Disclaimer

Sometimes the line isn't very clear between the chapters. Some actions might be considered part of the vulnerability analysis-phase, but it could also but considered part of the recon-phase. It is what it is.

These chapters are written sporadically with a lot of stuff missing. I just add stuff wherever whenever. Also, things might not be accurate, I might have misunderstood something or misused a tool. So don't trust me or this book for any accuracy.
