# Security Prepration Repository

Welcome to the Reboare/Booj Security wiki!

This was a fork of the [https://github.com/xapax/security](https://github.com/xapax/security) and [https://github.com/aranisec/security](https://github.com/aranisec/security) repositories, so the majority of the work in here is due to them, but I'll be adding and editing as I go through, so the majority of it from here on out will be my own work.

If you feel like this is a good start, but you want to add and remove things and just fork it and make it yours.  Hopefully we can all learn from each other in that way.

I will also be adding my writeups for various machines into this book for a few reasons.  Firstly, I'm quite lazy and don't have the energy at the moment to create and maintain a full blog, but since reporting is one of the few activities I'm quite weak at, I'm going to be attempting to write up as many of my solutions as possible.

Secondly, it's a fantastic learning resource, and since I hope that some people can learn from me as I have others then there's no better way than 

## Disclaimer

Sometimes the line isn't very clear between the chapters. Some actions might be considered part of the vulnerability analysis-phase, but it could also but considered part of the recon-phase. It is what it is.

These chapters are written sporadically with a lot of stuff missing. I just add stuff wherever whenever. Also, things might not be accurate, I might have misunderstood something or misused a tool. So don't trust me or this book for any accuracy.
