# Security Prepration Repository

Welcome to the aranisec/security wiki!

This is my security practice reference book created while preparing for PWK/OSCP certification.

Thanks to [xapax](https://xapax.gitbooks.io/security/content/) for this wonderful book. I have forked this book from his git book and trying add more stuff.

Any want to use and improve, you are free to fork it to make your own copy.

Also, this book is just a collection of stuff that is available on the interwebz. I am just a simple collector. I have tried to include a reference section to show where I found the technique. This book is my way of trying to give something back to the infosec community and I hope it can be useful to someone.

You can read this book on [https://aranisec.gitbooks.io/secpreprepo/content/](https://aranisec.gitbooks.io/secpreprepo/content/). If you feel like contributing, or just forking it, you can do that from its github repo here: https://github.com/aranisec/security/. If you feel like this is a good start, but you want to add and remove things and just make it yours you can just fork it and do whatever you want with it.

## Disclaimer

Sometimes the line isn't very clear between the chapters. Some actions might be considered part of the vulnerability analysis-phase, but it could also but considered part of the recon-phase. It is what it is.

These chapters are written sporadically with a lot of stuff missing. I just add stuff wherever whenever. Also, things might not be accurate, I might have misunderstood something or misused a tool. So don't trust me or this book for any accuracy.
