# Reverse Engineering

## .Net 

If dealing with a .net binary then the easiest way to decompile is to use [dotPeek](https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/).  This can decompile and then export the decompiled binary as a project, making it incredibly easy to debug and work out behaviour.  Of course this is assuming no obfuscation has taken place.
